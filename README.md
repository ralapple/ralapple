Hello, Im Ray, I am a student at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities studying computer science and math with an emphasis on becoming a full-stack developer or work with some type of machine learning. 

My expected graduation date is May of 2025 and I am actively looking for an opportunity to expand my skills and knowledge through an internship or part time position.

My repos are mainly porjects that I have completed through the University or in my free time.

My recent projects explore with javascript and API calls and returning that information back to a web page created using html and css. Check them out under Weather_api repository!
